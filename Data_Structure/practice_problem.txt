Practice Lab Question

Module Name:  Algorithms and Data Structures Using Java .

Q.1 Implement linear probing using 2D array (bucketing) using same H(x)=x%10

Q. 2 Double circular linked list.

Q.3 Implement linked list sorting function.

Q.4 implement code and merge and linked list.

Q. 5
Using
Two Queues
The idea is to implement the queue’s enqueue operation such that
the last entered item always ends up at the queue’s front. To achieve this, we
need an additional queue.
1.
To push an item into the stack, first move all elements from the
first queue to the second queue, then enqueue the new item into the first
queue, and finally move all elements back to the first queue. This ensures that
the new item lies in front of the queue and hence would be the first one to be
removed.
2.
To pop an item from the stack, return the front item from the
first queue.

4.Check
if an expression is balanced or not.

Q. 5
? Implement stack through array 
? Implement queues with inserting element at different location (First, Last) 
? Implement circular queue
